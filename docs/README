This is the documentation source for django-treebeard.
You can read the documentation in:

http://docs.tabo.pe/django-treebeard/tip/

Or read the documentation for this version re reading the .rst files in this
directory.

If you want to build the docs you'll need the graphviz tool, if you are using
a Mac and Brew you can install it like this:

$ brew install graphviz

Then you'll need at least Django and sphinx:

$ pip install Django==1.5
$ pip install sphinx

To build the docs you need a _static dir and then run the sphinx-build command:


$ cd docs/
$ mkdir _static
$ sphinx-build -W -b html -d /tmp/doctress . /tmp/html
